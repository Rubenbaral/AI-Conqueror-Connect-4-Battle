# Ai-Powered-Connect-Four
This is a Python script for a Connect-4 game with an AI opponent. The game board uses a 2D NumPy array. Players drop pieces turn by turn. The AI uses a MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to decide its move. The game ends when there's a 'winning move' or a full board.
